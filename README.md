# WeatherApp
A very simple weather app that is integrated with weather API that displays the current 
weather by country or city. Its just an application I tried to build for practicing javascript 
and promises.

# Technology
Since the app was built for practice purpose, it was created in vanilla javascript with :

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Promises(fetch/then)
